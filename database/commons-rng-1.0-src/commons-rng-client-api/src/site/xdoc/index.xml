    <section name="Apache Commons RNG: Random Numbers Generators" href="summary">
      <p>
        Commons RNG provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are
        either faster or of higher quality (and sometimes both) than <code>java.util.Random</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "client API" module contains the code that defines the API for client code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example:

<source>import org.apache.commons.rng.UniformRandomProvider;

public class Dice {
    public int roll(UniformRandomProvider rng) {
        return 1 + rng.nextInt(6);
    }
}
</source>
      </p>

      <p>
        Browse the <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadoc</a> to see the complete API.
