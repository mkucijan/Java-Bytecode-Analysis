    <section name="Apache Commons RNG: Random Numbers Generators" href="summary">
      <p>
        Commons RNG provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are
        either faster or of higher quality (and sometimes both) than <code>java.util.Random</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "core" module contains pure Java implementations of algorithms that generate
        pseudo-random sequences of numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          This module is not intended for direct use by applications.
        </b>
        For instantiating a generator, application developers are advised to use the
        factory methods provided by the "commons-rng-simple" module.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadoc</a> is available for the benefit of
        developers who would like to contribute to this library.
